1. Introduction

uninno is a portable unpacking tool for Inno Setup (IS) installers.

It was originally conceived as a means to extract the data files from
GoG (Good old Games) installer packages. Back then, these games were
usually only for offered for the Microsoft Windows operating system.
This was a bit disappointing, because there existed alternative means
of playing these games on other platforms. Unfortunately, there was no
easy way to obtain the contents of these packages, so the author started
writing a new tool in a portable script language, Perl.

After initial success, uninno also became a bit of a research project
for studying computer language parsing and automatic code generation.

It will still be updated occasionally, when new Inno Setup versions are
released.

3. Usage

To just use uninno as a Inno Setup extractor, run the uninno.pl utility.

$ ./uninno.pl setup.exe

It will extract all files from the application part of the installer archvive
and put them into ./app

Various Perl modules are required. You can either install them from CPAN or
using your package manager (if available).

These are:
 Switch
 DateTime
 Digest::CRC
 IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate
 IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2
 Compress::Raw::Lzma
 Crypt::RC4
 
On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, use the following command to install all dependencies:
 
$ sudo apt install libswitch-perl libdatetime-perl libdigest-crc-perl libcompress-raw-lzma-perl libtext-glob-perl libio-stringy-perl libcrypt-rc4-perl xz-utils


4. Code

uninno consists of a bunch of Perl packages that handle different stages of the
analysis and extractiong process. Dissection of the installer executable is
provided by Win::Exe, which has some submodules for each of the PE's parts.
Setup::Inno provides a frontend for parsing the setup.0 (metadata) and setup.1
(compressed files) parts of the Inno Setup installer.

To improve code reuse and facilitate handling of all the installer versions,
all version-specific code is represented by a class hierarchy, starting with
a base class containing mostly stubs, continuing with support for the first
open source Inno Setup release (2.0.8), and going up to the most recent version.
Each class in the hierarchy has override points that implement headers,
decompression and custom handling required for this version or its descendants.

Secondary to that is a set of data structure parsers for each exact Inno Setup
version. These can be generated from the Inno source code, as outlined below.

Version numbers are coded in 4 digits: x.y.z -> xyzz. The last version part has
two digits and is zero padded. Example: 2.0.8 -> 2008

Inno Setup has used many different compression algorithms in the course of its
history, with varying degrees of compatibility with standard software.
zlib, bzip2, LZMA and LZMA2 compression are supported by uninno, using
corresponding Perl modules.
LZMA compression uses a lot of memory currently and performance is poor, as
the API of Compress::Raw::Lzma is very low-level and hard to use in a
straight-forward way. A better implementation may be written in the future.

Starting with support for Inno Setup 5.5.0, a new approach is used to create the
various structure parsers. Using a custom Delphi grammar based on an old edition
of the Delphi Language Guide, Projects/Struct.pas from the Inno source code
is processed and dissected. Then, a Perl module is generated that can parse
binary data represented by the data structures in that file. The grammar can be
found in DelphiGrammar.pm, the code for the generator is in ParserGenerator.pm.

To generate a new parser, you need the Perl module Marpa::R2. You also need the
specific Inno Setup Struct.pas you would like to implement support for.
The makeissrc.pl utility can clone the official git repository for you and
optionally download and patch in older versions from their respective source
files. It will put the repository into ./innosetup by default.
The tool needs the tools wget, unzip and git to do its work.

makestruct.pl can then be used to access this repository and to generate a
new parser for a specific Inno Setup version.

For example:
$ ./makestruct.pl --src ./innosetup --version 5.5.0u

Versions with a u at the end are Unicode versions, which means that all strings
are interpreted as UTF-16. Non-Unicode installers used to have their strings
stored in Windows code page 1252, but more recent installer may also specify
the used code page in the data structures. Support for this has not been
implemented yet.
It is recommended to always generate Unicode and non-Unicode versions
when creating a parser for a new version.
Output will go to Struct5500u.pm in this case, which needs to be put into
Setup/Inno/ to make Inno.pm find it.
